# Status-update
## Week 2
This past week, we held several team meeting with the team lead, Nevon Song and other students that will be contributing to the Levigo project from other institutions. We developed a slack channel where we can stay in contact and share documents. It has proven to be a useful tool for sharing important information and coordinating our meetings. This week we coordinated different research topics and generalized each of our contributions for the rest of the semester. This week, Iconducted research on a CI/CD pipeline that could help us develop a bug free code for Levigo. Developing a CI/CD pipeline could help us automate many of the steps in the software delivery. I also did research on tools for testing app development. Since Levigo will be in early development, we expect many bugs initially. To help mitigated this issue we hope to use tools for app testing to easily identify these bugs. Lastly, we held an android studio introduction to help us all become more familiar with it. 

## Week 3
This past week, I spent a significant amount of time practicing HTML. Since I did not have much of an opportunity to contribute to the project, I thought this would be a good chance to develop my coding skills. I used Code Academy and watched several YouTube tutorials to begin to learn the basics of HTML. I began by learning how to format things in HTML like headers and other basics of webpage development. I also began watching YouTube tutorials of other basic front end languages like CSS and Javascript. I hope to continue practicing and learning with the use of Code Academy and further extend my logic to fully being able to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Along with this, I conducted some research on barcode scanning technology and tools for testing app development on the Android operating system. 

## Week 4
This past week, I spent some time testing the Levigo App. With the use of a Samsung Android phone and Android studio simulators we were able to successfully test the app by scanning barcodes of real medical equipment. These barcodes were provided by Nevon through photos. I tested several different brands of medical equipment. When testing them we considered how quickly the barcode would scan, if it would autofill the data, and how accurate the information was. I found that the app was somewhat inconsistent in terms of whether it scanned the barcode or not. When scanning the pictures of the barcodes, it was more reliable when the barcodes were scanned off of a cellphone compared to a computer. Also, I found that one medical equipment brand was successfully scanned more consistently than the others. Further testing may be needed to discover if these inconsistent were a result off picture quality. Lastly, the barcode scanner was not as quick as we would have hoped. However, for the barcodes the app successfully scanned the autofill feature worked well. This week I also worked on writing a test script to automate the code with one of my teammates. Lastly, I joined the design team for the Levigo app because currently the app UI is plain.
